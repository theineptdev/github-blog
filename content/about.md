If we haven't met, **my name is Gunner Clark**. I'm a software engineer with a passion for health and fitness. When I'm not building apps or frying PCBs I'm researching and testing different methods to improve health and performance. 

This blog is intended to be a place for me to share anything that I feel is worth putting out into the world. I'm sure I'll also use it to ramble about my latest hyperfixation. Time will tell!
