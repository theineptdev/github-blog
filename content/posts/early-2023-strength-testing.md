I'm starting the year off with a few tests for my current strength training program.

## My Current Strength Training

Every movement marked with (*) is performed for 1 set of 60 seconds to failure using accommodating resistance. Mobility movements, marked with (~), are performed for 2 sets of 30 seconds using contract-relax PNF stretching. The Kettlebell Swing is used exclusively for cardio, I perform 1  heavy set for 60s with the goal of reaching between 90 and 100 percent of my max heartrate (Zone 5). Each movement is performed only once per week using an Upper/Lower split.

Upper Body:
- Planche Pushup*
- Loaded One Arm Chin Up*
- Handstand Pushup*
- Front Lever Row*
- Eagle Hang~
- German Hang~

Lower Body:
- Loaded Single Leg Squat*
- Nordic Leg Curl*
- Pigeon Stretch
- Front Split~ (this will change alongside the "Mobility Carryover" test)
- Middle Split~ (this will change alongside the "Mobility Carryover" test)
- Kettlebell Swing

## Strength Carryover

First I'm testing to see if my Back Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift improve without direct work using my current strength program.

I'll start by testing my 1 rep max for the Back Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift. After 6 weeks of strength training using my current program I'll retest my 1 rep maxes to see if they have improved.

## Muscular Endurance Carryover

After the "Strength Carryover Test" I'll be testing to see if those same exercises provide carryover to muscular endurance.

To test this I'll set a baseline by performing 1 set of Back Squats (barbell loaded with bodyweight), Pushups, and Pull Ups to concentric failure. After 6 weeks of my current strength training I'll test again and compare the results.

## Mobility Carryover

The third test is for lower body mobility. It has two parts. I'll be testing to see which combination of mobility movements provide the largest range of carryover for my mobility goals.

These are the lower body mobility movements I currently want to improve:

- Front Split
- Internal Rotation Middle Split (knees facing forward)
- Pike
- Pancake
- Ankle Flexion

For all mobility tests I'll start by checking my current range of motion on all the listed movements. After 4 weeks of using the selected mobility training method I'll retest my mobility to check for carryover.

#### 1. Front Split vs Jefferson Curl and Split Squat

This first part will compare two methods of increasing hamstring and hip flexor mobility. `Method B` is likely to have more carryover to other movements *but* `Method A` will take less time to perform. I'll hoping to find that the Jefferson Curl and Split Squat carryover to the Front Split.

`Method A:`
- Front Split
- Internal Rotation Middle Split (knees facing forward)

`Method B:`
- Jefferson Curl
- Split Squat
- Internal Rotation Middle Split (knees facing forward)


#### 2. Internal Rotation Middle Split vs External Rotation Middle Split

This second part only occurs if the first part provides little to no Pancake carryover. In place of the Internal Rotation Middle Split I'll perform the External Rotation Middle Split. I'll be testing to see if the External Rotation Middle Split provides carryover to both the Pancake and Internal Rotation Middle Split.

`Method:`
- Results from Part 1 (Front Split or Jefferson Curl and Split Squat)
- External Rotation Middle Split (knees facing up)

## Summary

For the "Strength Carryover" test I'm hoping to find that leverage-based bodyweight strength movements carryover to loaded barbell movements. The "Muscular Endurance Carryover" test should show whether or not one set of 60 seconds to failure is enough to improve muscular endurance. As for the "Mobility Carryover" test I'm looking for the least amount of exercises I need to perform to achieve my mobility goals. I'll provide updates as I get the results.
