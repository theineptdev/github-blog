I'm starting the year off with a couple tests for my current strength training program.

## Strength Carryover Test

First I'm testing to see if my Back Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift improve without direct work using my current strength program. This is my current exercise selection:

- Loaded Single Leg Squat
- Nordic Leg Curl
- Planche Pushup
- Loaded One Arm Chin Up
- Handstand Pushup
- Front Lever Row

I'll start by testing my 1 rep max for the Back Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift. After 6 weeks of strength training using my current exercise selection I'll retest my 1 rep maxes. If the 1 rep maxes increases then I'll know there is carryover.

## Mobility Carryover Test

The second test is for lower body mobility. It has two parts. I'll be testing to see which combination of mobility movements provide the largest range of carryover for my mobility goals.

These are the lower body mobility movements I want to improve:

- Front Split
- Internal Rotation Middle Split (knees facing forward)
- Pike
- Pancake
- Ankle Flexion

For all mobility tests I'll start by checking my current range of motion on all the listed movements. After 4 weeks of using the selected mobility training method I'll retest my mobility to check for carryover.

#### 1. Front Split vs Jefferson Curl and Split Squat

This first test will compare two methods of increasing hamstring and hip flexor mobility. `Method B` is likely to have more carryover to other movements *but* `Method A` will take less time to perform. I'll be testing to see if the Jefferson Curl and Split Squat provide carryover to the Front Split.

`Method A:`
- Front Split
- Internal Rotation Middle Split (knees facing forward)

`Method B:`
- Jefferson Curl
- Split Squat
- Internal Rotation Middle Split (knees facing forward)


#### 2. Internal Rotation Middle Split vs External Rotation Middle Split

This second test only occurs if the first test has little to no Pancake carryover. In place of the Internal Rotation Middle Split I'll perform the External Rotation Middle Split. I'll be testing to see if the External Rotation Middle Split provides carryover to both the Pancake and Internal Rotation Middle Split.

`Method:`
- Results from Part 1 (Front Split or Jefferson Curl and Split Squat)
- External Rotation Middle Split (knees facing up)

## Conclusion

For the "Strength Carryover Test" I'm hoping to find that leverage-based bodyweight strength movements carryover to loaded barbell movements. As for the "Mobility Carryover Test" I'm looking for the least amount of exercises I need to perform to achieve my mobility goals. I'll provide updates as I get the results.
